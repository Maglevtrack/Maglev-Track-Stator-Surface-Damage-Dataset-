# Maglev-Track-Stator-Surface-Damage-Dataset-
The Maglev Track Stator Surface Damage Dataset (MTDD) is a large-scale dataset independently constructed for assessing the health status of maglev tracks. It was built using data collected from the Maglev Test Line at the Jiading campus of Tongji University. The MTDD contains images classified and annotated into five types of target categories, including scratch, crack, spalling stator seam (bound) and beam end tooth surface (beam end).Sample images from the dataset are shown the Figure below, from left to right, respectively: scratch, spalling, crack, beam end and bound.
